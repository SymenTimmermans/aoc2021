# How I REALLY learned Rust by doing Advent of Code

## FromStr is great

## From and Into traits are even better

## Implementing operators like std::ops::Add and std::ops::Sub is amazing

## Iterators should become second nature

## Testing is fun

## Rust is still not a 'compact' or 'economic' language
Saw other people's python solutions which were so much shorter than the Rust solutions i saw.

## But Rust is a great language that helps you think about solving problems in the most economic and safe way possible

## Though Rust is a great language, solving complex problems is hard

## Rust works great as a functional language
You don't always need structs with Impl blocks and traits.
If you make your structs Clone and Copy, you can create "pure" functions.

## The easiest way to test code is to write tests 


## Simple things

### Get used to taking in references to data if you only intend to read from them

### Dont derive Copy and Clone on everything, but do it if you need to

### It's ok to panic!()

### You can't deny the usefullness of the dbg!() macro

### thread_local! is very convenient.

### Implementing iterators is easy and opens up a whole new world of possibilities

### include_str! is better than reading files - sometimes

### The HashSet makes sense more often than you think

### Doctests are fun and convenient.
